This is a setup guide to make sure arduino is operating properly:

Connect the opto-interrupter BNC output cable to the FTS and Connect the red wire to the A0 pin on the arduino
board the black wire should be connected the ground pin on the arduino board this will reference the voltage read
by the anolog input pin A0 to a default of 5V.

Launch the 'optoAdc.ino' file using arduino IDE software:

	Verify the arduino is able to communicate via serial port. Check this by connecting the arduino
	to the computer through USB. Click on tools on the top of the arduino software window and select
	port. While using linux it should read something like '/dev/ttyACM0' where the 0 can be some different number. 
	

	Upload the sketch to the Arduino board by clicking the upload arrow in the top left of the arduino software.
	You might encounter 'error Error opening serial port ...' If you get this error, you need to set serial port permission.
	[[Read]] the "Please Read..." section here https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux

	[[PLEASE NOTE]]
	In order to be able to use the python script for the opto-interrupter make sure the '/dev/ttyACMX'
	matches the the port number for serial communication to work with the python code.

	-OPTIONAL-

	The 'optoAdc.ino' file has an optional opto-interrupter calibration in the setup function of the code if needed.
	Just uncomment it and upload the sketch to the arduino board again.
